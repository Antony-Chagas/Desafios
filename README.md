# Course Tracking System

## Introduction
Welcome to the Course Tracking System! This web application allows users to register their courses, track their progress, and manage their study activities effectively. The system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes features such as dark/light mode toggling and local storage for data persistence.

## Features
- **Add Courses**: Register new courses with total lessons and lessons watched.
- **Track Progress**: View progress for each course with interactive progress bars.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Easily switch between light and dark mode for a better visual experience.
- **Local Storage**: Automatically save data locally, so progress is not lost even after reloading the page.
- **Manage Courses**: Increase, decrease, or delete courses with intuitive, icon-based buttons.
